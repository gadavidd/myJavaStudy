# My Java Study Repository

Java was created in 1995 by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton at Sun Microsystems with the aim of providing a platform-independent programming language for building robust, high-performance applications. Over the years, Java has become one of the most widely used languages due to its versatility, scalability, and strong community support.

Java is crucial in the software industry, powering a vast array of applications, from enterprise-level systems and web applications to mobile apps on Android and large-scale data processing frameworks. Its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy has made it a staple in the development world, particularly for building cross-platform applications.

My professional journey began with Java, especially in the realm of constraint programming, which required a solid grasp of the language. TThis repository is a collection of practical code examples and solutions I have developed over time using IntelliJ IDEA. It focuses solely on hands-on code, without delving into theoretical aspects. Here, you will find key learnings, practical implementations, and useful snippets that reflect my experiences and insights gained while working with Java.

Feel free to explore and use the code in this repository for your own learning and projects. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!

I highly recommend considering the references listed at the end of this repository. All of them have been crucial for my comprehensive development in Java, and I am confident they will be invaluable to you as well. Happy learning!
